### Technical Documentation: User Management Dashboard Application

#### Overview
The User Management Dashboard is a full-stack web application designed to manage users through a modern, responsive interface. The frontend is built with Next.js and React, featuring a dark theme with glassmorphism effects, modals for user actions, and filtering capabilities. The backend is a GraphQL API powered by Apollo Server and Express, using MongoDB for data persistence. The application supports role-based access control, allowing Admins to add, edit, and delete users, while Users can only search and filter. The frontend communicates with the backend via GraphQL queries and mutations, ensuring a seamless user management experience.

### Backend Documentation

#### Architecture
The backend is a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server and Express, using MongoDB as the database. It provides endpoints for querying and mutating user data, with middleware for authentication and error handling. The API is secured with JWT-based authentication and role-based access control, restricting mutations to Admin users while allowing all authenticated users to query data. TypeScript is used for type safety, and `nodemon` is used for development with automatic restarts.

#### Setup Instructions
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory and run the command to install all dependencies listed in `package.json`.
2. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add the following variables:
     - MongoDB connection string (e.g., `MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/user-management`).
     - JWT secret (e.g., `JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key`).
     - Port number (e.g., `PORT=5000`).
3. **Set Up MongoDB**:
   - Ensure MongoDB is running locally or use a cloud service (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).
   - Update the `config/db.ts` file to connect to the MongoDB instance using the `MONGO_URI`.
4. **Seed the Database** (Optional):
   - Run the `seed.ts` script to populate the database with initial user data using `@faker-js/faker`.
5. **Run the Server**:
   - Start the development server using the command `npm run dev`, which uses `nodemon` for automatic restarts.
   - Alternatively, start the production server using `npm start`.
   - The server will run on `http://localhost:5000/graphql` (or the specified port).

#### Schema
The GraphQL schema defines the following:

**Types**:
- **User**: Represents a user with fields: id (ID), name (String), email (String), password (String, hashed), location (String, optional), joined (String, optional), role (String), status (String).
- **UserConnection**: A wrapper for paginated user data, with fields: users (array of User objects) and totalPages (Integer).

**Queries**:
- **users(page: Int!, limit: Int!, search: String)**: Retrieves a paginated list of users with optional search filtering by name or email.

**Mutations**:
- **createUser(input: UserInput!)**: Creates a new user (Admin-only).
- **updateUser(id: ID!, input: UserInput!)**: Updates an existing user (Admin-only).
- **deleteUser(id: ID!)**: Deletes a user (Admin-only).

**Inputs**:
- **UserInput**: Input type for creating/updating users, with fields: name (String), email (String), password (String, optional), location (String, optional), role (String), status (String).

#### Resolvers
The resolvers implement the logic for the GraphQL schema:

- **users Query**:
  - Queries the MongoDB database for users, applying search filtering (case-insensitive) on name and email if provided.
  - Paginates the filtered users based on the page and limit arguments.
  - Returns a UserConnection object with the paginated users and total number of pages.
  - Requires the user to be authenticated (throws an "Unauthorized" error if not).

- **createUser Mutation**:
  - Hashes the password using `bcryptjs` before saving.
  - Creates a new user in the MongoDB database with a generated ID and current timestamp for the joined date.
  - Restricted to Admin users (throws an "Unauthorized" error if the user is not an Admin).
  - Returns the created user object.

- **updateUser Mutation**:
  - Updates an existing user in the MongoDB database by ID with the provided input fields.
  - Restricted to Admin users (throws an "Unauthorized" error if the user is not an Admin).
  - Throws a "User not found" error if the user ID does not exist.
  - Returns the updated user object.

- **deleteUser Mutation**:
  - Deletes a user from the MongoDB database by ID.
  - Restricted to Admin users (throws an "Unauthorized" error if the user is not an Admin).
  - Throws a "User not found" error if the user ID does not exist.
  - Returns a boolean indicating success.

#### Database
The backend uses MongoDB as the database, with Mongoose for object modeling:
- **User Model**: Defined in `models/User.ts`, includes fields for id, name, email, password (hashed), location, joined, role, and status.
- **Connection**: Established in `config/db.ts` using Mongoose, connecting to the MongoDB instance specified in the `MONGO_URI` environment variable.
- **Seeding**: The `seed.ts` script uses `@faker-js/faker` to generate fake user data for testing purposes.

#### Security
- **Authentication**:
  - Uses JWT for authentication, implemented in `middleware/auth.ts`.
  - The middleware extracts the JWT from the Authorization header, verifies it using `jsonwebtoken`, and adds the user to the request context.
- **Authorization**:
  - Mutations (createUser, updateUser, deleteUser) are restricted to users with the "admin" role.
  - Queries are accessible to all authenticated users.
  - Unauthorized access results in an "Unauthorized" error.
- **Password Hashing**:
  - Passwords are hashed using `bcryptjs` before storage in the database.

#### Middleware
- **auth.ts**: Handles JWT authentication, verifying tokens and adding the user to the GraphQL context.
- **validate.ts**: Validates incoming requests (e.g., ensuring required fields are present, email format is valid).
- **errorHandler.ts**: Centralized error handling for consistent error responses.

#### Error Handling
- **Unauthorized Access**: Throws an "Unauthorized" error if the user is not authenticated or lacks the required role for mutations.
- **Not Found**: Throws a "User not found" error if a user ID does not exist during update or delete operations.
- **Validation**: Uses `validate.ts` middleware to enforce input validation (e.g., email format, required fields).
- **Database Errors**: Handled by `errorHandler.ts` to return consistent error messages.

#### Notes for Production
- Use a production-grade MongoDB instance (e.g., MongoDB Atlas) instead of a local database.
- Implement rate limiting and request logging for security and monitoring.
- Add additional validation for user inputs (e.g., password strength, unique email).
- Use a secure JWT secret and rotate it periodically.

### Integration Notes
- **Frontend-Backend Integration**:
  - The frontend uses Apollo Client to communicate with the GraphQL API at the endpoint `/graphql` (e.g., `http://localhost:5000/graphql`).
  - Apollo Client is configured in `lib/apollo.ts` and provided to the application via a root provider ( in `app/layout.tsx`).
  - The frontend sends JWT tokens in the Authorization header for authenticated requests, managed by `lib/auth.ts`.
- **Authentication Flow**:
  - Users log in via `app/login/page.tsx`, receiving a JWT token from the backend.
  - The token is stored (likely in local storage or cookies) and used for subsequent requests.
  - The `useAuth` hook retrieves the token and user data, ensuring protected routes like the dashboard are accessible only to authenticated users.
- **Testing**:
  - Test the frontend by running the Next.js development server and accessing the dashboard page.
  - Test the backend by running the Apollo Server and using the GraphQL playground to execute queries and mutations.
- **Environment Variables**:
  - Frontend: Configure `NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_URL` in `.env.local`.
  - Backend: Configure `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, and `PORT` in `.env`.
